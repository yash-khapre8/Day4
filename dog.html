    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; margin: 10px;">
        The Labrador Retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds in the world. Known for their friendly nature, intelligence, and loyalty, Labradors are excellent family pets, as well as reliable working dogs. They are often used in roles such as guide dogs, search and rescue, and therapy assistance due to their trainability and gentle temperament. Originating from Newfoundland, these dogs were initially bred to help fishermen retrieve fishing nets and escaped fish.

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Origins</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; margin: 10px;">
        The Labrador Retriever originated in Newfoundland, Canada, where it was initially known as the "St. John's dog" or "St. John's water dog." The breed was developed in the 1800s to assist fishermen by retrieving fishing nets and catches from the icy waters of the Atlantic. In the early 19th century, Labradors were brought to England, where they were refined and became the versatile working breed we know today.
    </p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Temperament</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; margin: 10px;">
        Labradors are known for their friendly, outgoing, and loving nature. They are extremely social and enjoy being around people, making them excellent family dogs. Their gentle demeanor also makes them great with children and other pets. They are highly intelligent and eager to please, which makes training them relatively easy. However, they can be energetic, so they require regular exercise to stay happy and healthy.
    </p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Health</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; margin: 10px;">
        Labradors are generally healthy dogs, but like all breeds, they are prone to certain health conditions. Some common health issues include hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, and progressive retinal atrophy. They are also prone to obesity if not exercised regularly and fed properly. Regular veterinary check-ups, a balanced diet, and consistent physical activity are essential to maintaining their health throughout their lives.
    </p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Appearance around the world</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; margin: 10px;">
        The appearance of Labrador Retrievers can vary slightly based on their geographical location and the specific breeding practices. In general, Labradors have a sturdy and balanced physique, but those bred for field work tend to be leaner and more agile, while show-type Labradors often have a broader, stockier build. Despite these variations, the Labrador's iconic features—short coat, strong build, and friendly expression—remain consistent around the world.
